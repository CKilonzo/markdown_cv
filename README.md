# Rmarkdown to CV templates

Here are a couple of my favorite and mostly simple RMarkdown to CV options. They have been kindly provided by others and adapted here.

## Version 01

Simple Markdown CV / Resume

**Acknowledgments:** The original CV template is based on [a version by Craig Eley](http://craigeley.com/09-05-2013/formatting-your-cv-with-markdown-and-latex/), with a couple of minor modifications to make it run with Pandoc.

**Requirements:** Requires Latex (http://latex-project.org/ftp.html) and Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to be installed on your system.

### Instructions

1. Edit the source file at: /source/cv.md
2. Run 'make pdf' in the folder containing the Makefile
3. A new PDF will be generated in the /output folder

## Version 02

A nice Rmarkdown template for a CV, adapted from http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/.

To use, simply edit the Rmarkdown file using the editor of choice (RStudio is native and effective), then knit to pdf.
